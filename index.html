I haven't been to that zoo in a while, maybe I'll go in October again, but maybe I'll forget tbh. Also the fact I'm not saying what year I wrote this in probably makes it worse. There were some cheetahs there though, and one of them had like worn the grass down. I don't know if the animal was bored or something, but it would like chase the safari trucks as they went by and it's like oh no is it gonna eat us, but I mean it was in a cage. But theoretically you could've jumped down in there and fought a cheetah if you didn't break your bones falling down the two-to-three story drop first. Snuggle the danger kitty? You could. Would it be worth it? Probably.`)">
