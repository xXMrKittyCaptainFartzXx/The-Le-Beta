        </ul>
      <time datetime="2025-08-06">8/06/25</time>
        <ul>
            <li>Turned "browsin.html" (which is for DIY CMS display) into "guysandgal-lerie-s.html" (Haha GET it it's like guys & gals but it's like galleries cuz it's a gallery HAHAHAHAHAAHA)</li>
            <li>Made ABOOTPAEG even *MORE* epic by adding, yes, my OWN bio to it now!!11!!</li>
            <li>Prettyin up the splash spage with MORE OPTIOSN and TEXTs for the NO BABIES zone. and whAT?? a BUTTONN?? WAHT DOES THAT DOO???</li>
            <li>Also I flicked the bean of the pages title thingy in da head to say othur stuff. Don't worry about what it said beforehand. i didn't document it and forgor. yw.</li>
            <li>ChatGPT bullied me and made me add some Aria accessibility stuff in my navigation WAAAAA</li>
            <li>However it did make me find out about adding titles in funny '< >' thingy which is the funny hovertext so OOOOOO win</li>
            <li>Update page updates page updates - HTML div to large sections, then sections in the sextions, details.</li>
            <li>Went through Notion and added a BUNCH of stuff to the the updates/to-do page. Well actually I put it in a "barf pile" and then asked ChatGPT to help split it up. And then it put emojis in front of it and I left it cuz it helps visually oh ho ho ho ho.</li>
        </ul>
      <time datetime="2025-08-05">8/05/25</time>

            <li>Planning out Static Site personalized, DIY specialized-CMS (via JS)</li>
            <li>Building out CMS bones in HTML, JS and JSON. (Took a really long time because I wanted to do my best to understand EVERY single line we were putting in. LMAO.)</li>

            <li>Longer-term Planning: Scaling from 2D (website) ‚Üí 1D (social media) ‚Üí 3D (Resonite). Community building. Then: moss cabin, queer commune, capitalism goes in the trash. Profit from quirky empire of cuddles & kisses & spiritual boners xoxoxoxo MWAHAHAAHAHA</li>
            <li>More planning: why Captain Googly-Purr is the best UI/UX decision evar and nobody else can argue because he is so cute and awesome and amazing and I love him and he made me cry like hours after I created him (possibly accidentally) and was talking to ChatGPT about it all and it made me more emotional cuz my heart oooooo OOO but also shhhh these are updatelogs back to not crying. Oh but also yeah i want to make him interact with the website more so I planned more. Kinda.</li>
